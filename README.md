TOP landing page

Took around 2 days split into 5-6 hours each and a 3rd day lasting around 2h to complete fully.

Day 1: Finished header, welcome section and footer.

Day 2: Finished random information section, quote section.

Day 3: Finished sign up section.

Difficulties faced:
------------------------------
Welcome section:

-Could not understand how to place text below each other
-Could not place image next to text

--Placed text into a flexbox separate from the image which was the issue the first time
--Placed text into a separate flexbox from image and then placing both into a flexbox


Random info section:
-Could not control the size of the pictures when shifting them


--max-width on images kept them the same shape throughout


Quotes section:
-Could not place quotee at the end of the quote line instead of the quote section

--Placed quotee and quote in a flexbox and placing it inside another flexbox instead of just a single flexbox. Align-items: flex-end will then move quotee to the end of the flexbox


Sign up section:
-Could not place place white border around button
-Was a bit confused with margins of everything

--Border syntax requires size, type of line and color but I omitted solid as type of line by accident
